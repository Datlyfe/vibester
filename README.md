If you wish you contribute to this project, this road map below that should give you a fair idea on what im planning to implement next:


- Playlists
- Shuffle, loop
- Other audio formats support
- Alternative theme maybe!
- speed control


This is what i have in mind at the moment but any ideas and suggestions are very welcome.
