If you wish you contribute to this project, this road map below should give you a fair idea on what i'm planning to implement next

- Volume Control
- Most Played Tracks (monthly,weekly,daily)
- Playlists
- Shuffle, loop
- speed control
- Other audio formats support
- Alternative theme


This is what i have in mind at the moment but any ideas or suggestions are very welcome.
